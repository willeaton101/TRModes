Welcome to TRModes's documentation!
===================================
This is a toolkit for understanding normal mode oscillations. We reccommend getting started by reading the overview below, and then looking at the installation page.

Overview:
=========
TRModes is a toolbox for calculating and visualising free oscillations (Normal Modes) of elastic bodies such as Earth or Mars.
The current version of TRModes only supports toroidal oscillations, though spheroidal modes will be implimented at some point (and we may have to rebrand to TRSModes!).
This program is predominantly provided as a toolkit for understanding the long-period oscillations of elastic bodies. While it
does calculate the desired eigenfrequencies for a spherically-symmetric, non-rotating, isotropic, elastic body, it is in no
way intended to replace or rival current community codes such as MINEOS_ or YSPEC. The intention is to provide 2D and 3D animated
figures of oscillations for use in classes or talks.

To get started, go to the installation page.
